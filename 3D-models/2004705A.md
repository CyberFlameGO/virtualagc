# General notes
The models are created to the exact dimensions from the original drawings. A few decisions were taken when re-creating them:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
* Part numbering (stenciled paint) are not added into model.

SolidWorks was used for the parametric drawings. Contact me (ManoDaSilva) you need them.

# Specific notes
* Pocket for external connector unclearly defined. Couldn't find the radii for one of the fillets. 
* Chamfers for the intermediairy mouting holes connectors aren't completely defined, used the dimensions for the ones above. 
* Some internal fillets might be missing
