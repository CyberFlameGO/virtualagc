# General notes
The models are created to the exact dimensions from the original drawings. A few decisions were taken when re-creating them:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
* Part numbering (stenciled paint) are not added into model.

SolidWorks was used for the parametric drawings. Contact me (ManoDaSilva) you need them.

# Specific notes
* The rubber gasket is not drawn in this model
* The gastket's notch depth is unknown. Set at .030 from scaling the drawings. 
* I *might* have found one mistake in the original drawings: the gasket's width isn't dimensioned at the mid-line (as the rest of the dimensions), but on the edges. However, using this dimension on the edges gives an off-centered gaskets which doesn't fit with what the plan shows.
