# General notes
The models are created to the exact dimensions from the original drawings. A few decisions were taken when re-creating them:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
* Part numbering (stenciled paint) are not added into model.

SolidWorks was used for the parametric drawings. Contact me (ManoDaSilva) you need them.

# Specific notes
* This model is only an external, dimensional model, as per the available specification control drawing.
* Terminal dimensions are non-logical. Setting the width to .1in makes the terminals way to wide. Used the manufacturer's datasheet instead.
