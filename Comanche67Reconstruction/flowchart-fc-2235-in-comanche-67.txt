( [Return to the main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

Unfortunately, FC-2235 is for Colossus 2D, and we have neither a list of changes from Colossus 2A nor from 2C.&nbsp; Therefore, there's no choice other than simply to compare each sheet of the flowchart against the reconstructed code, and then to play it by ear if there's a discrepancy found.

## Sheet 1

Just a cover sheet with no flowcharts.

## Sheet 2

VBZERO, OP/INERT, IMUZEROK:&nbsp; The TEST A decision box in the flowchart is rather confusing.&nbsp; If you follow the arrows, it seems to be saying that if A=0 it goes to ALM/END, and otherwise it goes to ALM/END.&nbsp; The flowchart's comments elucidate it a little.&nbsp; The A=0 exit from the TEST A decision box, and the YES exit from the NOUN 20? decision box elsewhere on the sheet, is really a branch to XACT0Q, which does nothing other than a RETURN.&nbsp; So I guess this is a trick to work around the fact that the AGC instruction set has a branch-if-zero instruction but no return-if-zero instruction.

The point of that is that by the time the NOUN 20? decision occurs, the Q register containing the return address is still the return address of the TC OP/INERT in VBZERO, so the return is to the next instruction in VBZERO, namely the TC IMUZEROK instruction.&nbsp; Whereas by the time of the TEST A decision box, Q has been incremented, so the return for the A=0 case is to the 2nd instruction after TC OP/INERT in VBZERO, namely the TC ALM/END instruction.&nbsp; Whereas otherwise, the TEST A decision exits directly to ALM/END without a return from OP/INERT.

With that understanding, the sheet vs code comparison looks good.

## Sheet 3

Continuation of IMUZEROK, CKMODCAD:&nbsp; Looks good.&nbsp;

## Sheet 4

VBCOARK, IMUCOARK:&nbsp; Looks good.

## Sheet 5

Continuation of IMUCOARK, ICORK2:&nbsp; Looks good.

## Sheet 6

OPTCOARK:&nbsp; I wonder why OPTCOARK makes a point of setting EBANK to EBANK5?&nbsp; As far as I can see, all of EXTENDED VERBS is EBANK 5.&nbsp; Why all of a sudden now?&nbsp;&nbsp;

But that's neither here nor there.&nbsp; All versions of Colossus do that.

Looks good.

## Sheet 7

Continuation of OPTCOARK, OPTC1:&nbsp; For some reason, the code of OPTC1 ends with

    TC	ENDEXTVB TC	ENDEXTVB

with the redundant ENDEXTVB being unreachable.&nbsp; It looks as though that's often done, not just in OPTC1, but only after calling IMUSTALL, because IMUSTALL has two possible branches upon return.&nbsp; In OPTC1, there's no call to IMUSTALL, and no need to do it.

In Artemis, OPTC1 ends in a single TC ENDEXTVB.&nbsp; I recall seeing a PCR/PCN/Software Anomaly Report somewhere about removing a redundant instruction, but there was no explanation of what the redundant instruction was, so I didn't worry about it.&nbsp; I wonder where I saw that?&nbsp; I see a couple of Artemis memos mentioning such stuff, but none relevant to this case, and I see ACB-97/PCR-810 which is certainly relevant to Comanche 67, but not to this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Was the redundant TC ENDEXTVB removed here in Comanche 67, or was it removed in Artemis?&nbsp; I find no hint of it in the Artemis memos, but that's not decisive; there were certainly other changes to EXTENDED VERBS in Artemis.&nbsp; &nbsp;By the same token, I find changes in Comanche 67 EXTENDED VERBS vs Comanche 55 from 3 separate PCRs.&nbsp; But none of the other changes from Comanche 55 to Artemis were in OPTC1 or within (say) a dozen lines of it.&nbsp; Luminary 116 has no OPTC1 subroutine, so it isn't comparable.&nbsp; All of which adds up to the fact that it seems to me undecidable where the removal had been performed.

**âš &nbsp;** I've created a preprocessor constant ReconstructionFC2235 to conditionally remove the redundant TC ENDEXTVB and experimented with it.&nbsp; If enabled, there's a regression in which banks 02 and 41, formerly cleared, now have checksum discrepancies of 00001.&nbsp; While that doesn't mean that they had been "correct" previously, I'm inclined to think that it means the change should be disabled.

By the way, in researching the redundant TC ENDEXTVB above, I happened to notice that the call to IMUSTALL in IMUFINEK is followed by a single TC ENDEXTVB.&nbsp; I wonder if that's correct?&nbsp; It looks like we'll get to that in a couple of sheets, so I won't worry about it now.

In other words, I think that Comanche 67 is okay as-is with regard to sheet 7.

## Sheet 8

IMUFINEK:&nbsp; Looks good.

## Sheet 9

Continuation of IMUFINEK, FINEK2:&nbsp; Looks good.

## Sheet 10

Just tables, no flowcharts.
