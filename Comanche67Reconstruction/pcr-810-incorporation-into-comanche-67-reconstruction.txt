( [Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

As usual, we don't have a copy of PCR-810, "YAW DAP CDU sampling".&nbsp;

Here's a little additional information.&nbsp; According to Mission Techniques Memo #41a, "H2 Odds and Ends", there was an ACB request outstanding for Colossus 2D, namely&nbsp;

> ACB 97&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Delete redundant line inadvertently inserted [in] implementation  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of PCR 810.

So whatever the implementation of PCR-810 was at least we know a little bug it left behind that we can look for.&nbsp; Also, it tells us that the PCR certainly involves code and isn't GSOP-only.

My thought is that perhaps this PCR has to do with the YAWDAP routine (as opposed to YAW DAP) in the TVCDAPS section.&nbsp; The YAWDAP routine sets up T5RUPT to call the PITCHDAP routine, which sets up T5RUPT to call YAWDAP, thus alternating with each T5RUPT.&nbsp; The YAWDAP and PITCHDAP routines do internally read the CDUX, CDUY, and CDUZ special registers, thus fetching the CDU data.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The PCR is thus telling us there's something amiss with the YAWDAP routine.&nbsp; We have the "TVC DAP" flowcharts which cover YAWDAP:

- [Colossus 2 FC-2440](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/E-2456-2C.pdf#page=205)
- [Colossus 2D FC-2440](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/E-2456-2D.pdf#page=592).&nbsp; YAWDAP begins on sheet 9.

In comparing the Comanche 55 and Artemis 71 versions of TVCDAPS, we find that they are largely the same, but with a handful of areas where we need to selectively decide what to keep from Comanche 55 and what to import from Artemis:

- At the top, Comanche 55 and Artemis have different bank selections.&nbsp; I think we must ignore those at the present time.
- Shortly after the beginning of PITCHDAP (yes, I know that from the PCR title it doesn't seem likely we're supposed to change PITCHDAP), there's a section of code called PSTROKER in Comanche 55 that's missing from Artemis.&nbsp; According to the Colossus 2D flowchart, we need to retain it as-is.&nbsp; In fact, there are no other differences between PITCHDAP in Comanche 55 and Artemis, so the entire subroutine is kept as is.
- Similarly, shortly after the beginning of YAWDAP there's a section of code called YSTROKER that's missing from Artemis.&nbsp; However, it is in the flowchart, so we keep it.
- Following the YSTROKER section, Artemis has a section called YCDUDOTS, followed by YINTEGRL.&nbsp; Comanche 55 does not have YCDUDOTS, and proceed directly to YINTEGRL.&nbsp; But YCDUDOTS is in the flowchart, so we import it from Artemis.&nbsp; YINTEGRL involves two new variables, YCDUYPST and YCDUZPST, that don't exist in Comanche 55.
- Much later in the code, in the DAPINIT subroutine, we find that Artemis initializes YCDUYPST and YCDUZPST.&nbsp; The [Colossus 2D flowchart FC-2430](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/E-2456-2D.pdf#page=564) ("TVC Start-up and Executive Routines") for DAPINIT does _not_ show this initialization; rather, it shows only the same initialization of PCDUYPST and PCDUZPST as Comanche 55.&nbsp; This is dubious, since it means that YCDUYPST and YCDUZPST wouldn't be initialized on the first pass through YAWDAP.
- Still later in the code, in 2DAPCAS, we find that Artemis has a two-instruction sequence (DDOUBL / DDOUBL) missing from Comanche 55.&nbsp; The flowchart (FC-2440 sheet 5) has this, so we must import it from Artemis.&nbsp; Very near that, in OPTVARK,&nbsp; Comanche 55 has a DDOUBL / DDOUBL where Artemis has merely a single DDOUBL.&nbsp; The same flowchart sheet just mentioned agrees with Artemis.

Other than the question of the (lack of) initialization of&nbsp;YCDUYPST and YCDUZPST, this all seems quite straightforward.&nbsp; The problem with the lacking initialization is that while we'd like to just throw our hands in the air and say "the initialization must have been added to DAPINIT in a later revision of the software," that's a bit difficult to swallow when we realize that:

1. Artemis (Colossus 3) was forked from Comanche 67 (Colossus 2C), rather than being a natural continuation from Colossus 2E.
2. Therefore, there would have to be two separate PCRs or PCNs for correcting the problem, one for Colossus 3 and one for Colossus 2E.&nbsp; For that matter, Skylark forked from Artemis somewhere between Artemis 3 and Artemis 19, so it's even possible that there would be a third PCR, for Skylark.&nbsp; Actually, while we do not have Skylark source code at present, we do have its "Programmed Guidance Equations" document, which attempts to be a faithful representation of the program in a kind of pseudo-code.&nbsp; According to it, [Skylark's DAPINIT routine did indeed initialize YCDUYPST and YCDUZPST](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/programmed-guidance-equations-skylark-002.pdf#page=119).&nbsp;
3. There are no known PCRs, PCNs, Software Anomaly Reports, or ACB requests relating to the initialization problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
4. It wouldn't be terribly surprising if there was a PCR we didn't know about ... but two (or even three) of them, and we no record of any?

Is this more likely, or is it more likely that somebody simply forgot to update the DAPINIT flowchart?&nbsp; Well, unfortunately it's hard to say.

Here's my game plan for implementing this in Comanche 67:&nbsp; Introduce new preprocessor constants Reconstruction810 and Reconstruction810Init for conditional assembly.&nbsp; Use the latter only for adding initialization of YCDUYPST and YCDUZPST to DAPINIT, and use the former for all of the other changes listed earlier.&nbsp; That way, the initialization can be easily enabled or disabled as desired.

When I went to make these changes, I found that they were already all in place due to prior analysis, except for the ReconstructionInit ones.&nbsp; So at least I've added a little new stuff to the mix.&nbsp; I did find that I may have overreached a bit, because the changes in 2DAPCAS and OPTVARK were attributed to PCR-811 instead of PCR-810; in other words, they're real changes, but just not justified by PCR-810 (if the prior analysis is correct).

âš &nbsp;In summary, the PCR was implemented in code.&nbsp; I found that the ReconstructionInit changes made the "goodness signature" of the build marginally worse, so I've temporarily disabled them.&nbsp; They can be revisited later.
