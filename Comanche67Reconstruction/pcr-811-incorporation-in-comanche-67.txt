====== PCR-811 Incorporation in Comanche 67 ======

([[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.]])

We have no copy of PCR-811, "TVC DAP gain change".

I'm not going to consider this PCR for the present time, because I've just finished considering PCR-810, and it appears as though thinking about this is just going to automatically direct my mind to what I learned during that analysis (and began remembering from the earlier analysis of PCR-811). Since I probably am not going to be able to consider it as a new problem right now, independent of PCR-810, I'm just going to assume for the present that my prior analysis was correct. Perhaps it will be possible to revisit it later when PCR-810 and the prior analysis of PCR-811 have been thoroughly forgotten.
