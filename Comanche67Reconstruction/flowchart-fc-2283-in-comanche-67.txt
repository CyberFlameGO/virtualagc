( [Return to the main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

Our only copy of FC-2283 is for Colossus 2D.&nbsp; My approach is to compare each sheet of the flowchart vs the reconstructed source code, and then to deal with any discrepancies on an _ad hoc_ basis.&nbsp; I do notice from diff'ing Colossus 237 vs reconstructed code vs Artemis that we should keep our eyes open for EARTHL and EARTHMXX.

## Sheet 1

Cover sheet, no flowcharts.

## Sheet 2

RP-TO-R, RPTORA, RPTORB, RPRPXXXX:&nbsp; Looks right to me.

## Sheet 3

R-TO-RP, RTORPA, RTORPB, RPRPXXXX (again):&nbsp; Looks right to me.

## Sheet 4

EARTHMX, EARTHL:&nbsp; Looks right to me.

## Sheet 5

MOONMX:&nbsp; Looks right to me, assuming NEWANGLE (sheet 8) really does return with the pushdown list pointer set to 8D.

## Sheet 6

Continuation of MOONMX:&nbsp; Looks okay to me.

## Sheet 7

Finale of MOONMX:&nbsp; Looks okay to me.

## Sheet 8

NEWANGLE:&nbsp; Looks okay to me.&nbsp; Note that BOV is not merely an overflow test, but also clears OVFIND.

## Sheet 9

Just tables.
