====== Flowchart FC-2283 Incorporation in Comanche 67 ======

([[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to the main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.]])

Our only copy of FC-2283 is for Colossus 2D. My approach is to compare each sheet of the flowchart vs the reconstructed source code, and then to deal with any discrepancies on an //ad hoc// basis. I do notice from diff'ing Colossus 237 vs reconstructed code vs Artemis that we should keep our eyes open for EARTHL and EARTHMXX.

==== Sheet 1 ====

Cover sheet, no flowcharts.

==== Sheet 2 ====

RP-TO-R, RPTORA, RPTORB, RPRPXXXX: Looks right to me.

==== Sheet 3 ====

R-TO-RP, RTORPA, RTORPB, RPRPXXXX (again): Looks right to me.

==== Sheet 4 ====

EARTHMX, EARTHL: Looks right to me.

==== Sheet 5 ====

MOONMX: Looks right to me, assuming NEWANGLE (sheet 8) really does return with the pushdown list pointer set to 8D.

==== Sheet 6 ====

Continuation of MOONMX: Looks okay to me.

==== Sheet 7 ====

Finale of MOONMX: Looks okay to me.

==== Sheet 8 ====

NEWANGLE: Looks okay to me. Note that BOV is not merely an overflow test, but also clears OVFIND.

==== Sheet 9 ====

Just tables.
