( [Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

According to sheet 1 of the flowchart, even though this is a Colossus 2D flowchart, only sheet 9 changed from Colossus 2 to Colossus 2C, and only sheet 7 changed from Colossus 2C to Colossus 2D.&nbsp; Therefore, sheet 9 should still be identical to its Colossus 2C revision.

Sheet 9 comprises DELLOOP and OK2DELAY.&nbsp;&nbsp;

It appears to me that there is no difference between sheet 9 of the spreadsheet and the current reconstructed code.&nbsp; An alarm code has changed due to PCR-801.1, and that's likely the flowchart change made from Colossus 2A to 2C.
