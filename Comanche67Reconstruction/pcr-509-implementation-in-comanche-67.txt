====== PCR-509 Incorporation in Comanche 67 ======

([[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.]])

We have no copy of PCR-509, "Eliminate P11 Interlock in R30".

According to the Colossus 3 GSOP's section 5, PCR-509 was already [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=7|incorporated in Colossus 1 (Colossus 237)]], but was [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=13|"reincorporated" in Colossus 2C (Comanche 67)]]. Moreover, it was //not// listed in MIT/IL's presentation for the Apollo 12 Flight Software Readiness Review (FSRR). [[pcr-250-implementation-in-comanche-67|I've argued elsewhere]] why I think why I think that this combination of conditions leads to the reasonable conclusion that in Comanche 67 the PCR represents only a documentation change.

It would be interesting to compare the baseline Comanche 55 R30 log section to pre-Colossus 237 R30, to see if there is indeed a change representing elimination of an interlock, but we have no Block 2 AGC program of an early enough vintage, since Colossus 237 is the earliest Block 2 (CM) code we have.

Summary: My inference is that PCR-509 is a documentation-only change, without a code change.
