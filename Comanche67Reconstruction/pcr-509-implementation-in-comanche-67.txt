We have no copy of PCR-509, "Eliminate P11 Interlock in R30".&nbsp;&nbsp;

According to the Colossus 3 GSOP's section 5, PCR-509 was already [incorporated in Colossus 1 (Colossus 237)](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=7), but was ["reincorporated" in Colossus 2C (Comanche 67)](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=13).&nbsp; Moreover, it was _not_ listed in MIT/IL's presentation for the Apollo 12 Flight Software Readiness Review (FSRR).&nbsp; [I've argued elsewhere](pcr-250-implementation-in-comanche-67) why I think why I think that this combination of conditions leads to the reasonable conclusion that in Comanche 67 the PCR represents only a documentation change.

It would be interesting to compare the baseline Comanche 55 R30 log section to pre-Colossus 237 R30, to see if there is indeed a change representing elimination of an interlock, but we have no Block 2 AGC program of an early enough vintage, since Colossus 237 is the earliest Block 2 (CM) code we have.

Summary: My inference is that PCR-509 is a documentation-only change, without a code change.
