We have no copy of PCR-832.1, "Remove Restriction of Running R05 only in P00".&nbsp; There is a matching PCR-832.2, incorporated into Luminary 109, so source-code comparison of Luminary 99 vs Luminary 116 could reveal implementation details portable into Comanche.&nbsp; LUMINARY Memo #100 provides slightly more information that probably applies to Comanche as well:

> Verb 64 was modified so that it could be used at any time to select R05.

Thus the PCR appears to ask merely for removal of a constraint that is checked when V64 is first selected.&nbsp; This occurs in EXTENDED VERBS, which calls the subroutine VB64.&nbsp; The first thing VB64 does is to call CHKPOOH.&nbsp; CHKPOOH, in turn, simply returns if P00 is active and aborts with an alarm if not.&nbsp; So the only change the PCR seems to need is to remove TC CHKPOOH from VB64 in EXTENDED\_VERBS.&nbsp; Indeed, we find exactly that change in Luminary 116 vs Luminary 99.&nbsp; I don't believe we have any flowcharts to cross-check against.

Action:&nbsp; Define preprocessor label Reconstruction832, and use it to conditionally assemble the removal of TC CHKPOOH just mentioned in Comanche.&nbsp;

In implementing this, I found that this change had already been made as a result of the prior analysis, but _also_ that an INHINT had been removed from VB64 because of the [Colossus 2C revision of flowchart FC-2360](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/E-2456-2D.pdf#page=467), "R05 S-BAND ANTENNA", which I failed here to notice was relevant.&nbsp; In spite of my claim above that no flowcharts were relevant, sheet 2 of FC-2360 does in fact have a flowchart for FC-2360, and Comanche 55's INHINT is indeed missing.&nbsp; As it happens, the INHINT was never present in Luminary 99, and thus my code-comparison of Luminary 99 vs Luminary 116 failed to detect its absence.&nbsp; It's a pity I didn't think to diff VB64 for Comanche 55 vs Luminary 99.&nbsp; So that's two things it didn't occur to me to check that would have revealed my error.&nbsp; Oh well!

In summary, fix incorporated into software.
