( [Return to the main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

FC-2240 is for Colossus 2C, and the cover page informs us that _only_ sheet 1 (the sheet following the cover sheet) was updated from Colossus 2 to Colossus 2C.

At a glance, two alarm codes have been changed on sheet 1 due to PCR-801.1 and therefore are already incorporated into the reconstructed code.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Actual comparison of sheet 1 to the reconstructed code reveals no differences.
