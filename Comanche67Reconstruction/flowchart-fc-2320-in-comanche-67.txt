( [Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

We have the Colossus 2C revision of FC-2320, but no indication of which sheets were changed since the prior revision.&nbsp; I'm going to use a source-code diff of Colossus 237 vs Comanche 55 vs Artemis 71 to determine which subroutines to compare to the flowchart, ignoring all subroutines which fully match across Colossus versions.&nbsp; Note that sheet 2 of the flowchart is an upper-level flow, not suitable for comparison vs code; more-detailed flowcharts appear on subsequent sheets.

## Sheet 3

TFFCONIC, TFFCONMU:&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 4

TFFRP/RA:&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.&nbsp;

## Sheet 5-6

CALCTPER, CALCTFF, MAXTFF1, INBOUND, SAVEDEN:&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 7-8

TFFXTEST, NEGTFF, ENDTFF, MAXTFF:&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 9

TFFELL, TFFELL1:&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 10

T(X):&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 11

TFF/TRIG, PREVGAM, VGAMCALC:&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 12

FISHCALC:&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 13

DELRSPL, CANTDO:&nbsp; Identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 14

Continuation of DELRSPL, GETARG:&nbsp; As for DELRSPL, it's identical across 237/55/71.

Regarding GETARG, the flowchart

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/virtual-agc-project/attachments/175942)

indicates that the variable LONG should be initialized as an (eventual) input for subroutine LALOTORV.&nbsp; The code omits doing so.&nbsp; In examining the code for LALOTORV, it does indeed require LONG as an input, and does use LONG in its computations.

However, this inconsistency in the source code persists throughout 237/55/71.&nbsp; I would infer that the flowchart is in correct in principle, but that the code fails to match the flowchart in every version.&nbsp; As a result, Comanche 67 should not be fixed.

Otherwise, looks okay.

## Sheet 15

AUGEKUGL, K1K2LOOP, K2CALC:&nbsp; As for AUGEKUGL and K1K2LOOP, they are identical across 237/55/71.

Regarding K1K2LOOP:&nbsp; Looks okay.

## Sheet 16

Continuation of K1K2LOOP, PHICALC, TGR26, TENT:&nbsp; The continuation of K1K2LOOP looks okay.

PHICALC looks okay.

TENT and TGRTENT are identical across 237/55/71.

## Sheet 17-20

Tables only, no flowcharts.
