( [Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

We have the Colossus 2A and 2D revisions of the flowchart.&nbsp; My strategy is to do a side-by-side comparison of the two revisions of the flowchart, and to compare the flowchart vs reconstructed source code only when the two flowcharts differ.

TVCDAPON, MRCLEAN, ENDMRC, TVCINIT1:&nbsp; 2A/1,2 vs 2D/2,3:&nbsp; Matched.

Continuation of TVCINIT1, TVCINIT2:&nbsp; 2A/3 vs 2D/4:&nbsp; Matched.

TVCINIT3:&nbsp; 2A/3 vs 2D/5:&nbsp; Matched

ATTINIT:&nbsp; 2A/4 vs 2D/6:&nbsp; Matched

NEEDLEIN, TVCINIT4:&nbsp; 2A/5 vs 2D/7,8:&nbsp; Matched

DAPINIT:&nbsp; 2A/6 vs 2D/9:&nbsp; Matched

TVCEXEC, ROLLPREP, NEEDLEUP:&nbsp; 2A/7 vs 2D/10,11:&nbsp; Matched.

VARGAINS, GAINCHNG, EXECCOPY:&nbsp; 2A/8 vs 2D/12,13:&nbsp; Matched, but the 2D flowchart explicitly mentions in GAINCHNG that FIXCW and S40.15 are called via IBNKCALL, whereas the 2A flowchart does not.&nbsp; I wonder if that means GAINCHNG or FIXCW or S40.15 have moved so that they are no longer in the same bank?&nbsp; However, in Comanche 55 they are already called via IBNKCALL, so this is probably just an editorial clarification.

1SHOTCHK:&nbsp; 2A/9 vs 2D/13:&nbsp; Matched.

1SHOTOK, TEMPSET:&nbsp; 2A/9,10 vs 2D/14:&nbsp; Matched

CORSETUP:&nbsp; 2A/10 vs 2D/15:&nbsp; Matched

CG.CORR:&nbsp; 2A/11 vs 2D/15: Matched

CORCOPY:&nbsp; 2A/11 vs 2D/16:&nbsp; Matched

CNTRCOPY:&nbsp; 2A/11 vs 2D/17:&nbsp; Matched

REDOTVC, EXECPHS:&nbsp; 2A/12 vs 2D/18:&nbsp; Matched

TVCDAPHS, FINCOPY:&nbsp; 2A/12 vs 2D/19:&nbsp; Matched.&nbsp; But the upon entering FINCOPY the 2A flowchart's comments mention that "RESTART OCCURRED DURING PITCHCOPY OR YAWCOPY SUBROUTINE", whereas the 2D flowchart's comments instead mention PCOPY and YCOPY.&nbsp; I suppose that this is simply an editorial correction.

ENABL1:&nbsp; 2A/12 vs 2D/20:&nbsp; Matched.

ENABL2:&nbsp; 2A/13 vs 2D/20:&nbsp; Matched.

CMDSOUT, PHSCHK2:&nbsp; 2A/14 vs 2D/21:&nbsp; Matched

CHKSTRK:&nbsp; 2A/14 vs 2D/22:&nbsp; Matched.&nbsp; The 2D flowchart specifically indicates that TVCINIT4 is called via POSTJUMP, whereas the 2A flowchart doesn't mention POSTJUMP.&nbsp; However, Comanche 55 code does already call TVCINIT4 via POSTJUMP anyway.

EXRSTRT:&nbsp; 2A/15 vs 2D/22:&nbsp; Matched.

MASSPROP, LEMTEST, LEMYES, LEMNO, STOINST:&nbsp; 2A/16 vs 2D/23:&nbsp; Matched

DXTEST:&nbsp; 2A/16 vs 2D/24:&nbsp; Matched

FIXCW:&nbsp; 2A/17 vs 2D/24:&nbsp; Matched

PEGGY, BOKKEP2, ENDMASSP:&nbsp; 2A/18 vs 2D/25:&nbsp; Matched

(Text only): 2A/19 vs 2D/26,27:&nbsp; Matched.&nbsp; (I only checked numerical constants.)

PRESWTCH, SWICHOVR: 2A/20 vs 2D/28:&nbsp; Matched

MCLEANJR:&nbsp; 2A/20,21 vs 2D/29,30: The 2A flowchart indicates the operation REPFRAL&nbsp;←&nbsp;FREPFRAC, whereas the 2D flowchart instead indicates REPFRAC&nbsp;←&nbsp;FREPFRAC.&nbsp; There is no REPFRAL in any version of Colossus.&nbsp; Colossus 2C uses REPRAC just as the 2D flowchart indicates.&nbsp; This must be an editorial correction to the flowchart rather than a change.&nbsp; With that understanding, the flowcharts match.

LOADCOEFF:&nbsp; 2A/22 vs 2D/31:&nbsp; Well, the 2A flowchart says "LOAOCOEF" rather than "LOADCOEFF", an obvious error (verified vs code).&nbsp; Otherwise, we seem to have a match.

In summary, seems okay as is!
