( [Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

We don't have a copy of PCN-659.1, "Suppression of X Moduloing by Kepler".&nbsp;

I would note, however, that PCN-659.2 (which we also don't have) applies what's presumably the same code fix to Luminary.&nbsp; So one would assume that if a code change to Comanche 67 (vs Comanche 55) is involved then we can possibly infer exactly what it is by seeing how it was done in Luminary code; though this is a little tricky, since the Luminary GSOPs aren't quite as forthcoming as the Colossus GSOPs are in disclosing precisely which revisions of Luminary are associated with which PCRs and PCNs.&nbsp; In this case, the Luminary 1E GSOP section 5 tells us that PCN-659.2 was incorporated into Luminary for Revision 4 of section 5, but doesn't enlighten us as to which revision of Luminary that correspond to.&nbsp; It does inform us, however, that additional material related to PCN-659.2 was added into the GSOP for Revision 7 of section 5, and that Revision 7 corresponds to Luminary 1C.&nbsp; Fortunately, we find that [the 28th SCB meeting approved PCN-659.2 for Luminary 1A](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/Memo-SCB28_text.pdf#page=8), so we can identify Luminary GSOP section 5 revision 4 with Luminary 1A.&nbsp; In other words, the code change for PCN-659.2 in Luminary, if any, should be identifiable by comparing Luminary 69 source code to Luminary 99 source code.

In advance of (and probably in lieu of) trying that, I'd note that it seems unlikely that there actually is any code change in Comanche 67, since:

- According to the [Colossus 3 GSOP section 5](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=9), PCN-659.1 was first applied to Comanche 2 (Comanche 44/45).
- Also according to the [Colossus 3 GSOP section 5](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=13), PCN-659.1 is being "reincorporated" in Comanche 2C (Comanche 67).
- PCN-659.1 is not listed among the PCRs/PCNs incorporated newly into Comanche 2C or 2B, according to [MIT/IL's presentation for the Apollo 12 Flight Software Readiness Review (FSRR)](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/apollo_12_fsrr_slides.pdf#page=5).

So far, for all other PCRs/PCNs analyzed to date, this constellation of facts has always indicated that in Comanche 2C the change is GSOP-only, relating to a code change made much earlier (in this case, in Comanche 2).&nbsp; (And by analogy, PCN-659.2 would be only a GSOP change in Luminary 1C, for a code change made earlier in Luminary 1A.)

However, we should attempt to:

1. Confirm PCN-659.1's code change in Comanche 2 (vs Comanche 1A).
2. Confirm that there was no additional related code change after Comanche 2 (say, in Artemis).
3. Confirm that there was a GSOP change in Comanche 2C related to the earlier code change.

With respect to confirming the Comanche 2 code change, I note the existence of a variable called XMODULO, and that in Colossus 1 (Colossus 237) and 1A (Colossus 249) this variable is subject to various manipulations in the KEPLERN routine in the CONIC SUBROUTINES log section.&nbsp; By Colossus 2 (Comanche 44) and continuing on to later Colossus revisions, XMODULO is never accessed in any way by the code.&nbsp; However, the variable itself is retained in Colossus 2 and Colossus 2A, even though not accessed.&nbsp; We have finally removed it in the current reconstruction of Comanche 67, but we've done so for unrelated reasons, namely to correct the addresses of certain pad loads.&nbsp; But that removal of XMODULO was entirely pragmatic and empirical ... it wasn't authorized by any PCR or PCN we knew about at the time.&nbsp; Hence it's possible that the removal of XMODULO (and its immediate successor in erasable, TMODULO) _may_ be the potential Comanche 67 code change authorized by PCN-659.1.

(As we would expect, the same situation occurs in Luminary:&nbsp; Luminary 69 manipulates XMODULO in KEPLERN, but Luminary 97 and beyond do not access XMODULO in any way; in fact, unlike Colossus 44-55, they eliminate the XMODULO variable entirely.&nbsp; Thus it's possible that PCN-659.2 was fully implemented in Luminary 1 code, whereas PCN-659.1 was only partially implemented in Colossus 2 code.)

In examining the present state of the reconstructed Comanche 67 code, I find that the elimination of XMODULO and TMODULO from ERASABLE ASSIGNMENTS has _already_ been marked with the preprocessor label "Reconstruction659", so I'd conclude that the previous analysis of this issue eventually came to the same conclusion that I've come to here.&nbsp; (I've not reexamined that prior reasoning before doing the analysis above.)

As far as GSOP changes are concerned, we fortunately have both the Colossus 1/1A and Colossus 2 GSOP sections 5.&nbsp; What we find is this:

- In the [Colossus 2 GSOP section 5's Figure 5.5-1](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/R-577-Colossus2-Martin-5.5.pdf#page=27) ("Kepler Subroutine" flowchart), the 3 sheets of the flowchart are marked with rather extensive change-bars, which the page footers attribute to PCN-659.1.
- In the [Colossus 1/1A GSOP Figure 5.5-1](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/NARA-SW/R-577-sec5-rev4-5.3-5.5.pdf#page=165), while I haven't done an extensive analysis or comparison to the source code, the change bars mentioned above are seen to be related to manipulations of the time and x.

Which is as we'd expect.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we do not have the Colossus 2A GSOP to compare with the Colossus 2 and Colossus 1/1A GSOPs.&nbsp; If a GSOP change needed to be made in Colossus 2C, it would be because of an error (such as a regression) in the Colossus 2A GSOP, and we have no way of knowing if there was such an error in the Colossus 2A GSOP or not.&nbsp; We also don't have the Colossus 2C GSOP, but we do have [Figure 5.5-1 from the Colossus 2D GSOP](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208461.pdf#page=329), and it shows only "editorial" change-bars (i.e., dotted-line change-bars) rather than "content" change-bars (i.e., solid lines), so we can conclude that the Colossus 2D Figure 5.5-1 is the same as the Colossus 2C Figure 5.5-1, except for the editorial changes.&nbsp; The editorial changes are actually just replacement of the subscripts "max" and "min" by "MAX" and "MIN" in a few places.&nbsp; Except for these editorial change, the Colossus 2D Figure 5.5-1 is _also_ the same as the Colossus 2 Figure 5.5-1.&nbsp; So whether or not there was a regression in the Colossus 2A Figure 5.5-1 or not, the Colossus 2C Figure 5.5-1 has returned to what it ought to be, as we'd expect.

In summary, I think what all that adds up to is that the principal changes for PCN-659.1, both coding and GSOP, occurred in Comanche 2.&nbsp; However, some coding cleanup (removal of XMODULO and TMODULO) remained to be done in Colossus 2C.&nbsp; GSOP changes may or may not also have occurred in Colossus 2C, but we presently have no means to determine so; nor is it relevant to coding issues in Comanche 2C.
