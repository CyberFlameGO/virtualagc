====== COM-13 Incorporation In Comanche 67 ======

( [[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page]].)

We have a copy of [[http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/COM-13.pdf|Software Anomaly Report COM-13]], whose problem description is

	The Noun 29 display in V78 (LAUNCHAZ CHANGE ) does not permit termination of the extended verb by a V34 response, in violation of basic groundrules

and whose recommended fix for Colossus 2C is

	Let V34E terminate the extended verb.

V78, for changing gyrocompass launch azimuth, is job AZMTHCG1 in log section IMU CALIBRATION AND ALIGNMENT. In comparing AZMTHCG1 in Comanche 55 vs Artemis 71, I see that the only difference is in a call to the GOFLASH subroutine, which has 3 possible responses: "terminate", "proceed", or "recycle". In Comanche 55, the "terminate" response simply mimics the "recycle" response, whereas in Artemis 71 it actually terminates. So I suppose that the change from Artemis should be imported into Comanche 67's IMU_CALIBRATION_AND_ALIGNMENT.gpp. I've done that using the preprocessor label "ReconstructionCOM13" for conditional assembly.

Incidentally, I note also that in Artemis, AZMTHCG1 has moved to a different memory bank (33â†’43). I've not chosen to duplicate that in Comanche 67, however, since the banksum discrepancy of bank 33 is very low at this writing. (The fix for COM-13 slightly worsens the discrepancy, from 00003 to 00004, but still very low.)
