====== PCN-544 Incorporation in Comanche 67 ======

([[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.]])

We have no copy of PCN-544, "Change Obsolete SPS Thrust in Section 5". From the title alone, it would seem that in Comanche 67 this is a documentation change to section 5 of the Comanche GSOP rather than a code change.

As additional verification, though, I'd observe that:

* According to [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=8|section 5 of the Colossus 3 GSOP]], PCN-544 was implemented in either Colossus 1 (Colossus 237) or Colossus 1A (Colossus 249). Interestingly, in [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/NARA-SW/R-577-sec5-rev4-start-5.2.pdf#page=5|section 5 of the Colossus 1/1A GSOP]], PCN-544 is listed with a different but consistent title, "Correction to Fixed Memory Constant", more indicative of a software change.
* Also according to [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=13|section 5 of the Colossus 3 GSOP]], PCN-544 is only being "reincorporated" in Colossus 2C (Comanche 67).
* According to the [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/apollo//12//fsrr_slides.pdf#page=5|MIT/IL presentation for the Apollo 12 Flight Software Readiness Review (FSRR)]], PCN-544 is not listed as having been newly implemented in Colossus 2B or Colossus 2C.

I've [[pcr-250-implementation-in-comanche-67|argued elsewhere]] that this combination of conditions is indicative of a documentation-only change in Comanche 67, with no change to code.

Finally, we do have section 5 of the Colossus 1/1A GSOP in our Document Library ([[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/NARA-SW/R-577-sec5-rev4-start-5.2.pdf|beginning through section 5.2]], [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/NARA-SW/R-577-sec5-rev4-5.3-5.5.pdf|section 5.3 through 5.5]], [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/NARA-SW/R-577-sec5-rev4-5.6-end.pdf|section 5.6 onward]]), so we can look in it and see if SPS thrust is marked as a change as we expect. (Of course, even if it is so marked, that doesn't necessarily imply there's no code change; and if it isn't so marked, that doesn't imply there was a code change; but at least it would test our expectations.) We do indeed find such a change, on both pages 5.9-2 (Colossus 1 only) and 5.9-2A (Colossus 1A only), in which constant Fₛₚₛ (according to p. 5.3-21, the "prestored nominal thrust based on the engine selection switch Sₑ" for program P40) is assigned a value of 20,500 pounds, marked with a change-bar, which the page footer indicates was due to PCN-544. In terms of code, there's no fixed constant called "FSPS" or any reasonable variation that I've found, but in log section P40-P47 there is

	''FENG 2DEC	9.1188544 B-7	# SPS THRUST (20500LBS), SC.AT B+7 NEWT/E4''

which appears in every revision of Colossus 1, 2, or 3 available to us at present. Moreover, this is the only meaningful context in which "20500" or "20,500" appears in any of the AGC program comments for available software versions.

So it would seem we have reasonable grounds for supposing that FENG isFₛₚₛ and that it never changed in code after Colossus 237.

In summary, I infer that in Comanche 67, PCN-544 is a documentation-only change, representing a code change that happened previously in Colossus 237.
