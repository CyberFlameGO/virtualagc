We do not have a copy of PCR-961, "SIVB-TB6 E-Memory Routine".&nbsp; [Notes from the 33rd SCB Meeting](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/SCB33-691113.pdf) offer the following information:

    All Action Items from the previous meeting were closed at this meeting. These items were as follows:                   Item                                         Action                   PCR 961                  CMC Start of TB6 (E-memory Routine)                   Action:                  Flight Software Branch (FSB).  Determine the future                                            disposition of backup initiating the S-IVB Timebase 6.                                            That is, should the ground capability be retained                                            (MSFC IU software change) or should the CMC capability                                            be retained in E-memory or moved to fixed memory.                   Closed:                  By approval of PCR 973 for incorporation of T6JOB into                                            fixed memory.

Looking at the [notes from the 32nd SCB meeting](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/SCB-691009.pdf), I find that although PCR-961 is marked as "approved" for Apollo 12, there are remarks that&nbsp;

    MSC to investigate with MSFC forflights after Apollo 12. MIT recom- mends fix memory change for Apollo 14 & subsequent if MSFCcan't handle the problem.

It seems to me that it should therefore not have been marked as "approved" in the 32nd meeting notes, but rather as "pending" while awaiting the results of the MSC/MSFC investigation.&nbsp; The fact that it was marked "approved" for Apollo 12 fooled me into thinking that it actually had been approved, when all that was approved was further investigation.

In point of fact, we know that the E-memory routine mentioned was not moved to fixed memory in Apollo 12, because it is [the TB6JOB program which appears in the Apollo 12 CMC pad load](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/padload_12_cm.pdf#page=22).&nbsp; That this pad load is the same as the TB6 job described in the PCR can be verified because [there is a listing and description of the SIVB TB6 backup program in COLOSSUS Memo #222](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/mission_techniques_memo_39b.pdf#page=31).&nbsp; The program listed in COLOSSUS Memo #222 is word-for-word identical to the pad-loaded program.&nbsp; And obviously, if the program was in CMC fixed memory, then there would be no need to load it separately into erasable memory.

In summary, PCR-961 is _not_ applicable to Comanche 67, and I only thought it was applicable originally due to having incompletely assimilated what the SCB meeting notes reported about it.
