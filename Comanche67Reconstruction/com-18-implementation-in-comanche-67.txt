====== COM-18 Incorporation in Comanche 67 ======

([[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page]].)

Unfortunately, we don't have a copy of Software Anomaly Report COM-18, and know only the brief summary "Software Restart (BAILOUT or POODOO)".

It's at this point that I realize I have never really needed to understand the difference between a BAILOUT and a POODOO, and consequently have never learned, and cannot now find a reasonable summary of the difference. Here's the explanation given at the beginning of [[https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/E-2456-2C.pdf#page=24|the ALARM AND ABORT flowchart FC-2140]]:

* BAILOUT: Terminates in a software restart. Used by alarm conditions such as no vac areas available, too many tasks, etc.
* POODOO: Clears AVEGFLAG and V37FLAG. Inactivates all restart groups and terminates in a software restart, and GOTOPOOH and flash verb 37 for operator to select new major mode. Used by alarm conditions such as an attempt to take the square root of a negative number, illegal flashing display, etc.

To me, that appears to mean that BAILOUT will attempt to restart jobs that are in progress, whereas GOTOPOOH is a completely clean reset that doesn't attempt to restart any jobs.

In an algorithmic sense, the principal difference seems to be that GOTOPOOH executes the code called ABORT2, whereas BAILOUT does not ... though ABORT2 seems to have the capability itself to turn a POODOO into a BAILOUT, midstream. In the Comanche 55 baseline, ABORT2 does this if it discovers if the V37FLBIT flagbit ("AVERAGE G ON") is set. In Artemis, it does it additionally if bit 14 of EXTVBACT ("EXTENDED VERBS ACTIVE") is set. So I //suppose// that COM-18 could be demanding this additional behavior in ABORT2 for Comanche 67. In fact, this change could //not// appear in Comanche 67, from the following reasoning:

1. Artemis (revision 0) was forked from Comanche 67; and
2. PCR-1117.1 implemented this very change in Artemis 63, according to COLOSSUS Memo #301.

At this writing, unfortunately, I have no other ideas what COM-18 is about.

In summary, I have been unable to devise any fix for COM-18 so far.
