====== Flowchart FC-2530 Incorporation in Comanche 67 ======

([[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to the main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.]])

We have the Colossus 2C revision of the flowchart. It states that the sheets updated from Colossus 2A are 2, 31, and 34, so I'm only going to compare those specific flowchart sheets to the reconstructed code.

Sheet 2: Matches, although it reveals that in many of the sets of Colossus source code, NXXTBNN has been mistakenly transcribed as NXXTENN. (In other revisions, it is transcribed correctly.) This needs to be fixed, but given that I'm working in the comanche67 branch rather than in the main branch, I'm not sure just where it should be fixed, so I'll defer it until later.

Sheet 31: Admittedly, I'm not entirely sure how NEWMODEX gets to IMUTEST, bot other than my lack of understanding of that, it's a match.

Sheet 34: Matches, due to prior incorporation of Software Anomaly Report COM-13.
