( [Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.](comanche-67-reconstruction))

As usual, we have no copy of PCR-798.1, "Reset GLOKFAIL in R00".&nbsp; Also as usual with this PCR naming scheme, there is a dual PCR-798.2 incorporated into Luminary 102.&nbsp; Thus comparison of Luminary 99 source code vs Luminary 116 source code should reveal a detailed implementation which can be imported into Comanche 67.

The TBD provides the following explanation of GLOKFAIL:

> DESIRED ANGLES YIELD GIMBAL LOCK -  
> CALCGA COMPUTES DESIRED IMU GIMBAL  
> ANGLES FROM A SET OF N.B. VECTORS AND  
> DESIRED S.M. VECTORS FOR PRELAUNCH  
> AND INFLIGHT ALIGNMENT PROGRAMS. IF  
> THE DESIRED IMU ATTITUDE WILL RESULT  
> IN A MIDDLE GIMBAL ANGLE OF GREATER  
> THAN 60Â°, GLOK FAIL (BIT 14 OF FLAG-  
> WORD 3) IS SET AND PROGRAM ALARM IS  
> DISPLAYED.&nbsp;

The PROGRAM ALARM mentioned is 00401, though I guess this isn't really relevant to incorporation of the PCR.

Comparing Luminary 99 vs Luminary 116, grep'ing for GLOKFAIL, the only difference is that in ROO of FRESH START AND RESTART, the instructions TC DOWNFLAG / ADRES GLOCKFAIL are added between clearing of R04FLAG and MUNFLAG.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We also have the ["COLOSSUS II-D" revision of flowchart FC-2020](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/E-2456-2D.pdf#page=9), "FRESH START AND RESTART", which is kind enough to tell us that the only "COLOSSUS II-C" sheets different from "COLOSUSS II-A" and "COLOSSUS II-D" are 6, 8, and 26.&nbsp; Sheets 6 and 8 seem irrelevant to this issue, but sheet 26 of routine RAKE does show GLOKFAIL being cleared.&nbsp; However, it is cleared between clearing of 3AXISFLG and POOFLAG, which leads me to believe that the details of implementation of the PCR in fact differ between Luminary 116 and Comanche 67.&nbsp;

In point of fact, the implementation is _very_ different, in that Luminary simply has a sequence of TC UPFLAG and TC DOWNFLAG instructions to set or clear the flag bits, whereas Comanche has a table of 12 flag words (FLAGTABL) which it negates and uses to fill up the 12-word array of flagwords (STATE) in reverse order.&nbsp; I.e., it first fills STATE[11] (FLAGWRD11) with -FLAGTABL[11], and then downward until reaching STATE[0] (FLAGWRD0) and filling it with -FLAGTABL[0].&nbsp; There are no actual flagwords 10 and 11, but the STATE[] array allows for them anyway.&nbsp; All of this is completely inconsistent (in terms of implementation, not effect) with FC-2020.&nbsp; Thus to insure that GLOKFAIL is set/reset properly, we need only make sure that the FLAGTABL[3] is correct.&nbsp; In this case, it means that bit 14 of FLAGTABL[3] must be 1.

This is incorporated in Comanche 67 by introducing a preprocessor constant Reconstruction798 for conditional assembly, and setting bit 14 of FLAGTABL[3].&nbsp; I find this has already been done due to the previous analysis.

In summary, the PCR has been incorporated into the code.
