According to sheet 1 of the flowchart, the only changes between Comanche 2A and 2C were on sheets 3 and 4.

## Sheet 3

FINDVAC, SPVAC, SPVACIN, FINDVAC2, VACFOUND:&nbsp; It appears to me that the only change from Comanche 2A is that an alarm code was changed per PCR-801.1, which was already incorporated.

## Sheet 4

NOVAC, NOVAC2, NOVAC3, NEXTCORE, CORFOUND:&nbsp; Again, it appears to me that the only change is an alarm code already incorporated per PCR-801.1.
