====== Flowchart FC-2050 Incorporation in Comanche 67 ======

([[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.]])

According to sheet 1 of the flowchart, the only changes between Comanche 2A and 2C were on sheets 3 and 4.

==== Sheet 3 ====

FINDVAC, SPVAC, SPVACIN, FINDVAC2, VACFOUND: It appears to me that the only change from Comanche 2A is that an alarm code was changed per PCR-801.1, which was already incorporated.

==== Sheet 4 ====

NOVAC, NOVAC2, NOVAC3, NEXTCORE, CORFOUND: Again, it appears to me that the only change is an alarm code already incorporated per PCR-801.1.
