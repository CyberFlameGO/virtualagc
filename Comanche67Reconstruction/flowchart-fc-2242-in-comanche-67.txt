We have both the Colossus 2 and Colossus 2C revisions of FC-2242, but no&nbsp;_a priori_&nbsp;indication of which sheets have changed.&nbsp; Given that it is easier to compare flowchart to flowchart than flowchart to code, the approach I'll take is to do a detailed comparison of the flowcharts, and then only to compare against code where discrepancies between the flowcharts are found.

R57, P23ABRT:&nbsp; 2C/2 vs 2/1.&nbsp; The alarm code for BAILOUT differs, but that is accounted for in code by PCR-801.1.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is a match.

R57A:&nbsp; 2C/3 vs 2/1.&nbsp; For some reason, the Colossus 2 flowchart doesn't show the "terminate" branch for GOMARKFR returns, while the 2C flowchart shows "terminate" branching to GOTOPOOH.&nbsp; However both the Colossus 2 code (MANCHE45R2) and Colossus 2C code have the appropriate branch to GOTOPOOH, so this is a deficiency in the Colossus 2 revision of the flowchart.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is a match.

MARKDISP, R57B:&nbsp; 2C/4 vs 2/1.&nbsp; Same comments as for R57A above.

ENDR57:&nbsp; 2C/5 vs 2/1.&nbsp; Match.

(The remaining sheets of 2C are just tables.
