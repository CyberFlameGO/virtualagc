====== Flowchart FC-2242 Incorporation in Comanche 67 ======

([[comanche-67-reconstruction|Return to the main Comanche 67 reconstruction page.]])

We have both the Colossus 2 and Colossus 2C revisions of FC-2242, but no//a priori//indication of which sheets have changed. Given that it is easier to compare flowchart to flowchart than flowchart to code, the approach I'll take is to do a detailed comparison of the flowcharts, and then only to compare against code where discrepancies between the flowcharts are found.

R57, P23ABRT: 2C/2 vs 2/1. The alarm code for BAILOUT differs, but that is accounted for in code by PCR-801.1. Otherwise, there is a match.

R57A: 2C/3 vs 2/1. For some reason, the Colossus 2 flowchart doesn't show the "terminate" branch for GOMARKFR returns, while the 2C flowchart shows "terminate" branching to GOTOPOOH. However both the Colossus 2 code (MANCHE45R2) and Colossus 2C code have the appropriate branch to GOTOPOOH, so this is a deficiency in the Colossus 2 revision of the flowchart. Otherwise, there is a match.

MARKDISP, R57B: 2C/4 vs 2/1. Same comments as for R57A above.

ENDR57: 2C/5 vs 2/1. Match.

(The remaining sheets of 2C are just tables.
