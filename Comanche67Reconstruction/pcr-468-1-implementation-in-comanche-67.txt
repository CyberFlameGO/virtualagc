We have no copy of PCR-468.1 ("Change R-32 to Program P-76").&nbsp; [The Colossus 3 GSOP's section 5](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=6) notes that PCR-468.1 had already been implemented prior to Colossus 237, but also that [it is "reincorporated" in Comanche 67](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/HSI-208454.pdf#page=13).&nbsp; I have elsewhere given [reasons for inferring that such a "reincorporation" is therefore a documentation-only change](pcr-250-implementation-in-comanche-67).&nbsp; This inference is reinforced by observing that the MIT/IL presentation for the Apollo 12 Flight Software Readiness Review (FSRR) did not include PCR-468.1 among [the list of PCRs/PCNs implemented in Colossus 2C or 2B](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/apollo_12_fsrr_slides.pdf#page=5).

It would be interesting to compare the baseline Comanche 55 code to Colossus code to the original incorporation of the PCR, to see what changes may have been involved, but that's presently impossible since Colossus 237 is the earliest Block 2 (CM) code we have.

Summary:&nbsp; I conclude that PCR-486.1 in Comanche 67 is a documentation-only change, without any actual software change.
