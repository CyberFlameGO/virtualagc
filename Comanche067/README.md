The Comanche067/ folder contains the attempt at reconstructing Comanche 67 source code (Apollo 12 CM), working from the baseline of Comanche 55, with reference to previously-reconstructed Artemis 71 source code and the available contemporary documentation.

The reconstruction is currently incomplete.  The reconstruction effort is covered in detail in issue #1140 (https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1140).
