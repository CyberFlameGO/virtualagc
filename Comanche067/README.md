The Comanche067/ folder contains the attempt at reconstructing Comanche 67 source code (Apollo 12 CM), working from the baseline of Comanche 55, with reference to previously-reconstructed Artemis 71 source code and the available contemporary documentation.

The reconstruction is currently incomplete.  

The reconstruction effort is covered in detail in issue #1140 (https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1140).  Also, during this reconstruction process, you cannot hope to successfully edit or build the reconstructed code without consulting the crucial documentation near the beginning of the Makefile (https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/comanche67/Comanche067/Makefile).
