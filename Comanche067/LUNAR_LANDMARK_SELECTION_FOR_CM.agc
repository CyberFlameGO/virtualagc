## Purpose:	Part of the source code for Comanche 67 (Colossus 2C),
##		the one-and-only software release for the Apollo Guidance 
##		Computer (AGC) of Apollo 12's command module.  In the 
##		absence of a contemporary assembly listing for Comanche 67, 
##		the intention is to reconstruct the source code from a 
##		Comanche 55 (Colossus 2A, Apollo 11 CM) baseline and 
##		contemporary documentation describing the differences 
##		between the two.  Page numbers listed in the program 
##		comments follow Comanche 55 unless otherwise noted.
