    <h2><a name="Background"></a>Background</h2>
    <p>As explained on <a href="LVDC.html">the Saturn Launch Vehicle
        Digital Computer (LVDC) page</a>, the LVDC was the digital
      computer that guided Apollo's Saturn rockets, while other types of
      computers (principally the Apollo Guidance Computer, or AGC for
      short) guided the Command Module and Lunar Module.&nbsp; An
      extensive collection of AGC software survives, for many of the
      Apollo missions.&nbsp; However, only a tiny amount of LVDC
      software has become available to us:&nbsp; namely, <i>one</i>
      LVDC flight program for a proposed but unflown mission known as
      AS206-RAM.&nbsp; But also, we have the software for something
      called the PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program ... which for brevity we
      refer to as the PAST program.&nbsp; The PAST program is the focus
      of this particular page.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The Programmable Test Controller (PTC) was test equipment which
      contained a slightly-modified LVDC CPU and whose purpose was to
      test the CPU design as well as to provide debugging capabilities
      for the software.&nbsp; The PAST program itself, meanwhile, was
      software that ran on the PTC and consisted primarily of such test
      procedures.&nbsp; Thus while from the viewpoint of the Apollo era
      the PTC's CPU was not precisely an LVDC CPU, and the PAST program
      was not precisely LVDC software, from a viewpoint 55 years later
      (when I'm writing this), it's much more convenient to think of the
      PTC is as being an LVDC and the PAST program as being LVDC
      software.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The reason this is significant is that while the Virtual AGC
      Project is excited to be able to provide LVDC software publicly
      (to the extent that the U.S. regulatory environment allows us to
      do so), the main purpose is to provide working software emulations
      of the original Apollo-era flight computers, including the LVDC,
      which are capable of accurately running that original flight
      software.&nbsp; The existence of the original PAST program — even
      more so that the existence of the original flight programs —
      advances this goal by helping us to validate the software
      emulation of the CPU.&nbsp; That's because successfully running a
      test program in the emulator gives us much more confidence that
      the emulation works properly than merely running a flight program
      would.&nbsp; After all, even though a flight program may run, how
      could we be fully confident that it runs <i>correctly</i>?&nbsp;
      Whereas the PAST program provides its own pass/fail criteria for
      correctness, so successfully running the PAST program according to
      its own internal criteria is a pretty decisive judgement on the
      correctness of the emulator as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In terms of emulating the PTC, what this means is that we
      distinguish between emulation of the PTC's CPU and the remainder
      of the PTC — i.e., its front panel and other support
      electronics.&nbsp; The same dichotomy exists between emulating the
      LVDC as a CPU, and emulating its "peripherals", such as the LVDC
      Manual Exerciser (LVDCME, which is like the PTC's front panel but
      specialized for use with a true LVDC) or the Saturn rocket.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The only available PTC documentation does not necessarily answer
      all the questions one has in terms of creating the PTC emulation,
      although in some limited respects <a
        href="Documents/19730064345_1973064345.pdf">the LVDCME
        documentation</a> can fill in some of those gaps, due to the
      great similarity between the two.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Setup"></a>One-Time Setup</h2>
    The PTC emulator comprises two programs that run on your local
    computer:&nbsp; the LVDC/PTC CPU emulator and the PTC front-panel
    emulator.&nbsp; The former is a program which typically has to be
    built from its source code before being run on your computer, while
    the latter is a program that is written in the Python language and
    does not need to be built but does require that Python 3 be
    installed on your computer.&nbsp; You should consult <a
      href="LVDC.html#yaLVDC_the_LVDC_CPU_Emulation">the LVDC page</a>
    for instructions as to how to acquire/build the CPU-emulation
    software.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, the source code of the PAST program itself needs to be
    "assembled" into an executable form which can be used by the
    emulator.&nbsp; You can either do this yourself with <a
      href="LVDC.html#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">the
      instructions on the LVDC page</a>, or else you can use the
    pre-built version of it that's already available in our software
    repository.&nbsp; In the discussion that follows, we'll assume the
    latter since it's automatic without you making any additional
    effort, but you can adapt the instructions if you choose the former.<br>
    <br>
    The net result of all this is that <i>somewhere</i> on your local
    computer, depending on your choices above, you'll find a folder
    called "yaLVDC", in which you'll find these files:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>yaLVDC (or yaLVDC.exe) —the LVDC/PTC CPU emulator<br>
      </li>
      <li>yaPTC.py (and some other *.py files) — the PTC front-panel
        emulator<br>
      </li>
      <li>PAST.tsv, PAST.src, PAST.sym, PAST.listing — the "assembled"
        form of the PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Starting_Up_the_PTC_Emulation"></a>Starting Up the PTC
      Emulation</h2>
    Assuming you've successfully performed the one-time setup from the
    preceding section, you can run the emulations like so:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Open up two separate command-line prompts.</li>
      <li>At each of the command-line prompts, 'cd' to the yaLVDC folder
        described in the preceding section.</li>
      <li>At one of the command lines, execute this command:&nbsp; "<tt>./yaLVDC







          --ptc --cold-start --run --assembly=<i>PRO</i><i>GRAM</i></tt>".&nbsp;
        This starts the LVDC/PTC CPU emulation running the <i>PROGRAM</i>
        program.&nbsp; For the sake of discussion, let's suppose that <i>PROGRAM</i>
        is "PROC9".&nbsp; The specific program to run depends on which
        particular set of test procedures you want to try, but PROC9
        (the PTC Self-Test Program) is the one for test procedure 9, and
        by far the most-comprehensive test.&nbsp; Later on, there will
        be a table that lists the specific <i>PROGRAM</i> for each test
        procedure.</li>
      <li>At this point, the <i>PROGRAM</i> is just running freely in
        the emulated CPU, without any input from the PTC front
        panel.&nbsp; Don't do anything additionally at <i>this</i>
        command line (such as hitting a keyboard key), since that would
        pause the emulation and give you access instead to yaLVDC's
        native LVDC/PTC debugger.&nbsp; If that happens accidentally,
        just type the command <tt>PANEL</tt> or <tt>CONTINUE</tt> into
        yaLVDC's native debugger to resume the emulation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>At the second command line, execute this command:&nbsp; "<tt>./yaPTC.py</tt>".&nbsp;







        This starts the PTC front-panel emulation.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    These two programs talk to each other using what I call "virtual
    wire".&nbsp; That's a networking system in which yaLVDC is a
    "server" and yaPTC.py is its client.&nbsp; By default, the
    assumptions of this system are appropriate for the case of yaLVDC
    and yaPTC.py running on the same computer as our instructions have
    implied, but there's nothing to stop you from running them on two
    entirely separate computers if you find it convenient to do
    so.&nbsp; Hopefully, a message will appear that says:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>Connected.</tt><br>

    <a href="yaPTC-screenshot.png"><img src="yaPTC-screenshot-small.png"
        title="Click to enlarge" alt="" width="698" height="400"
        border="2" align="right"></a>At any rate, once started, yaPTC's
    simulated control panel should then appear, and it will look
    something like the screenshot to the right (click to enlarge).<br>
    <br>
    The interface is graphical, so further interaction with the
    emulation involves observing whether the emulated indicator lamps
    turn on or off, clicking on controls representing pushbuttons or
    toggle switches, etc. All of the numerous black or white rectangular
    boxes you see in the screenshot are indicator lamps which are white
    when lit or black when not lit.&nbsp; Some of them, additionally are
    either momentary or latching pushbuttons that can click with a
    mouse.<br>
    <br>
    For instance, consider the PROG ERR indicator, located approximately
    midway down at the far right of the interface.&nbsp; It lights up
    under control of the PAST program, after the program has found an
    error when running its self-tests.&nbsp; But once the PROG ERR lamp
    lights, the PTC CPU (and hence the PAST program) has no programmatic
    way to turn the lamp off.&nbsp; Instead, the PROG ERR indicator is a
    momentary pushbutton in addition to being an indicator lamp;
    originally, to reset the PROG ERR lamp (i.e., turn it black), you
    were supposed to physically press the PROG ERR pushbutton.&nbsp; In
    the case of the emulation, that means you instead mouse-click PROG
    ERR on the emulated panel.<br>
    <br>
    Both yaLVDC and yaPTC.py have a few additional command-line options
    that could prove to be of use sometimes.&nbsp; Those for yaLVDC are
    described on the LVDC page, while those for yaPTC.py are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>--host=<i>IP</i></tt> to select the network host running
        yaLVDC.&nbsp; By default it's "localhost" (127.0.0.1, the local
        computer), but if you want to run yaLVDC on a different computer
        than yaPTC.py, it could be any host name recognized by your
        computer or any IPv4 address (like 192.168.0.123).<br>
      </li>
      <li> <tt>--port=<i>N</i></tt> to select the networking port yaPTC
        uses to find yaLVDC.&nbsp; The default is 19653.</li>
      <li><tt>--resize=1</tt> to make the yaPTC window resizable.&nbsp;
        By default I make it non-resizable, simply because I haven't put
        in any of the effort needed to make it resize <i>gracefully</i>,
        and because I personally have lots of display-screen real estate
        ... but that's of no help to you if you're stuck on a tiny
        laptop screen, so for whatever it's worth, the option is at
        least here for you to try it out if need be.</li>
      <li><tt>--help</tt> to get a full list of available command-line
        switches.</li>

          height="256" border="0" align="right"></a>Before getting into
      the details of how to work with the PAST program's test procedures
      in the emulation, you may want to have a little familiarity with
      the PTC's physical layout.&nbsp; I suppose, in theory, that you
      could run the self tests entirely from yaLVDC's native debugger
      without using the PTC's panels and other peripheral devices, but
      the test procedures are not written in a way that facilitates
      that, so it would be much harder to do so.&nbsp; And it wouldn't
      be as fun.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The photo to the left gives you an overview of some of the
      portions of the PTC main console used in the emulation.&nbsp; The
      Tape Reader and Mode Control Panel, though shown, isn't actually
      needed by the emulation, since the software is loaded from
      yaLVDC's command line rather than from a tape drive.&nbsp; The
      Tape Reader, by the way, accepted a punched tape, not a magnetic
      tape.&nbsp; One of the test procedures refers specifically to a
      short paper tape, although perhaps longer mylar tapes may have
      been used when the PAST program was read.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, among the items truly needed by the emulation,
      the C. E. Panel apparently hadn't been installed when the
      photograph was taken, so our handy caption just points to an empty
      space.&nbsp; How the C. E. panel fits into the indicated space in
      the PTC cabinet isn't clear to me, but that's life!&nbsp;
      Hopefully the photo gives you an idea of the general layout, in
      spite of its deficiencies.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We do know that the printer (photo to the right) was an IBM 1443,
      and that the plotter was a Calcomp 565. </p>
    <p>The PTC's typewriter peripheral isn't depicted in any photos I've
      found, nor have I been able to determine its model number.&nbsp;
      It printed stuff and had a keyboard, so what more is there to know
      about its visual appearance, really?&nbsp; I would hazard a guess
      that it was a modified IBM Selectric Typewriter, for whatever an
      uninformed guess from me is worth.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To run the test procedures in the PAST program, the principal PTC
      interfaces you have to interact with are the three control panels,
      which are obviously a bit too small to see in the photo above, so
      below you'll find a more-detailed representation of those.&nbsp;
      Clicking on any of them should give you enlarged view.&nbsp; Not
      everything you see is reproduced in the emulation precisely as-is,
      because not all of it is relevant to emulation of the PTC's CPU or
      running the PAST program's self-test procedures.&nbsp; For
      example, the emulated PTC has no power supplies, so emulating the
      Power Control area of the Processor Display Panel (bottom of
      far-right image) would be rather pointless.<br>

    Now, the purposes of all the various controls on these panels may
    not be obvious to you at first glance, nor is the original PTC
    documentation very forthcoming about how many of them work.&nbsp; At
    least, they were not obvious to <i>me</i>.&nbsp; But I'm
    nevertheless going to resist the temptation of providing a detailed
    writeup of the individual controls here, because such a description
    would be even too dry and unreadable even for me ... which as you
    can tell from the remainder of this website would have to be pretty
    darn dry and unreadable indeed!&nbsp; And I know this for certain,
    because I started adding such a writeup, and found I had to remove
    it immediately afterward in order to retain any semblance of
    sanity.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"> If
    there's a clamor for such descriptions in the future, I'll try again
    later to add something helpful along those lines.<br>
    <br>
    A couple of brief remarks may be worthwhile, though.&nbsp; On the
    center panel, normally abbreviated as MLDD, you'll notice that many
    of the controls appear in pairs, half labeled <tt>COMPUTER</tt> and
    the other half labeled <tt>COMMAND</tt>.&nbsp; The former are
    indicator lamps directly reporting the status of the CPU while the
    latter are combination lamps/pushbuttons which the technician
    operating the test panel used to configure settings.&nbsp; For
    example, in the topmost area of the MLDD, the INSTRUCTION address
    area, the <tt>COMPUTER</tt> lamps tell you the current instruction
    address at which the CPU is paused, while the <tt>COMMAND</tt>
    pushbuttons allow you to select a probably-different address, which
    could subsequently be used as a breakpoint.&nbsp; On the left-hand
    panel, normally abbreviated as CE — and no, I've found no
    explanation anywhere of what "C. E." stands for — you'll see an
    ACCUMULATOR area, which for some reason has 58 indicators even
    though the <tt>ACC</tt> register as we know it from all of the
    earlier discussion on this page, has only 26 bits.&nbsp; Or at most
    28, if you include parity bits.&nbsp; The answer appears to be that
    while the 26 (28) bits are all you can access from software,
    internally to the CPU, the accumulator has many more bits, all of
    which are visible from the PTC front panel.<br>
    <h2><a name="Performing_the_Test_Procedures"></a>Performing the Test
      Procedures</h2>
    At any rate, the test procedures described here are derived from
    chapter V of <a href="Documents/19730064346_1973064346.pdf">the PTC
      documentation</a>.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The first few calibration procedures and test procedures covered
    there are of no particular use to us, since they relate to
    irrelevant hardware characteristics of the PTC itself rather than to
    its CPU or software.&nbsp; For example, the PTC had physical
    power-supply circuitry which needed to be adjusted and checked for
    proper voltage levels.&nbsp; The emulated PTC has no such thing, and
    therefore obviously requires no calibration or checks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Moreover, various of the test procedures require loading specific
    test programs into the PTC CPU, and since we don't have the code for
    most of those test programs, the associated test procedures are only
    partially useful.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    With those thoughts in mind, here's a brief summary of how this
    affects the utility of the test procedures available in the PTC
    documentation.&nbsp; Also, to save the trouble of poring through the
    original PTC documentation, I've cloned the relevant test procedures
    into a more-convenient form, correcting typos where I saw fit, and
    providing my own comments as to how the instructions have to be
    interpreted in order to use them in our emulation.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="#Starting_Up_the_PTC_Emulation">As mentioned earlier</a>,
    one of the things you have to do to run the test procedures on the
    emulated CPU is to start the emulated CPU using the command "<tt>./yaLVDC







      --ptc --cold-start --run --assembly=<i>PRO</i><i>GRAM</i></tt>",
    and I promised that the specific value of <i>PROGRAM</i> would be
    given later; that's one of the things in the table below.&nbsp; The
    PAST program itself is used in only one of the procedures, procedure

            have not yet done so.&nbsp; Test procedure #5 seems to work
            fine if the program PROC9 is used instead; procedures 6-8,

            For those few steps, the corresponding lines of code in the
            software have been commented out and replaced by an equal
            number of instructions which have no effect, thus preserving
            memory addresses but bypassing the failing steps.<br>
