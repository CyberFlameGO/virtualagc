These source-code files are part of a reconstructed copy of Comanche 44, the
initial release (though not the final mission release) of the Apollo 10 
Command Module (CM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) software.  Subsequent releases
were Comanche 45 and Comanche 45/2 (the flown release on Apollo 10). The reconstruction
is believed to be exactly accurate, but in the absence of an actual Apollo-era
listing of Comanche 44, some explanation of the reconstruction process is needed
to insure confidence in that accuracy. 
<br><br>
The starting point was the source code of Comanche 51 
(separately previously reconstructed from an Apollo-era listing of Comanche 55, 
flown on Apollo 11).  Comanche 51 source code was then modified 
by undoing changes known to have been made between revisions 44 and 51. The now-reconstructed 
Comanche 44 source code was verified by assembling it and checking that the assembled code had
the expected known-correct memory-bank checksums. 
Note that page numbers in the reconstructed code match those on the Comanche 55 printout,
although the source code would likely have different page numbers in a contemporary
Comanche 44 listing.
<br><br>
Annotations that were not present in the contemporary source code have been added to the reconstructed
code to justify each change relative to Comanche 51. Here's a guide to the Apollo documentation referenced
in those annotations:<br>

       The software revisions <i>from which</i> and <i>to which</i> the changes occurred
       are indicated by the markings next to the document page number:
       <ul>
       <li>"Rev. 0" pages:  change bars are from Colossus 249 to Comanche 45</li>
       <li>"Rev. 1" pages:  change bars are from Comanche 45 to Comanche 45/2</li>
       <li>"Rev. 2" pages:  change bars are from Comanche 45/2 to Comanche 55</li>
       </ul>
</ul>
In most cases, only the titles (rather than the full texts) of PCRs are known.  In addition to the 
explanatory annotations, there is also 
<a href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1134">
a step-by-step commentary about the reconstruction process</a>.
<br><br>
Comments expected to have been present in the original source code are prefixed with a single '#' symbol, 
whereas comments added later are prefixed by "##" or "###".  Report any errors 
noted by creating an

<b>Reconstruction:</b> We don't know of any surviving specific contemporary
documentation supporting the material in this log section, absent an
Apollo-era assembly listing of it.  The section contains
only comments and no executable code.  We have simply modeled the Comanche 44 version of it on the 
corresponding log section of Comanche 55, but have changed a handful of
items in ways that seem sensible to us.  The annotations below thus 
provide our common-sense reasoning on the matter, rather than justification from documentation.

<b>Reconstruction:</b> The signature names and titles below are not
actually known for certain.  Because Comanche 44 through 55 were separated by
only 1-3 months in time (see below), we assume that personnel turnover 
in that limited period of time would be unlikely. Hence we have retained the 
same names and titles for Comanche 44 as for Comanche 55. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, the DATE fields below are more speculative, 
and are very likely to be wrong but unlikely to be <i>too</i> wrong.  Consider the document
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/a042186.pdf#page=52">
<i>Software Systems Development: A CSDL Project History</i>, Table 4-6</a>.
From the data in that table, and from the Comanche 55 source code, here is
a timeline of events for your consideration:<br>
<ul>
<li>March 28, 1969:  Signoff date in Comanche 55's CONTRACT AND APPROVALS
log section.</li>
<li>April 18, 1969:  Colossus 2A released.  We presume that this refers to
the release of Comanche 55.</li>
</ul>
From this timeline, we conclude that for Comanche 55, CONTRACT AND APPROVALS signoffs
occurred 3 weeks prior to the official release date of the software.
<br><br>
To use that information, however, requires knowing the release date for 
Comanche 44, which does not appear in the reference just mentioned.  The best
information we're aware of comes from
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/R-700.pdf#page=170">
<i>MIT's Role in Project Apollo, Final Report</i>, Table 4-II</a>.  There,
we see release dates of<br>
<ul>
<li>February, 1969:  Comanche 44 released.</li>
<li>April, 1969: Comanche 55 released.</li>
</ul> 
which is consistent, but which unfortunately lacks some specificity.  At any 
rate, noting that Comanche 44 was released sometime between February 1 and 
February 28, and then subtracting 21 days, we guess that the software signoffs
occurred somewhere between January 11 and February 7.  The midpoint of that
range is January 24, which in 1969 was a Friday.
