These source-code files are part of a reconstructed copy of Luminary 178, the
final release of the Apollo 14 Lunar Module (LM) Apollo Guidance Computer
(AGC) software. 
<br><br>
The reconstruction began with source code of Zerlina 56, Luminary 210, and 
Luminary 131, previously transcribed from digitized copies of those programs.
The code was created by combining the three, using Zerlina 56 as a base, since
it was based off of Luminary 183. The differences between the three were
carefully merged using the Luminary memos as a guide, with all changes made
after Luminary 178 being backed out. The reconstruction was verified by matching
memory-bank checksums to those listed in drawing 2021152N.  Note that page numbers
in the reconstructed code match those for the baseline log section mentioned in
each file's changelog; the page numbers for a real Luminary 178 listing would
be different.
<br><br>
Comments from the original source code are prefixed with a single '#' symbol, 
whereas comments added later are prefixed by "##" or "###".  Report any errors 
noted by creating an 
issue report at <a href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/issues">the Virtual AGC
project's GitHub repository</a>.

Luminary 178, as a release version, likely had explicit version numbers for
all of the subroutines hardcoded. Since this has been reconstructed from
multiple distant versions, the exact version numbers of each subroutine are
unknown, and so they have been left blank.
